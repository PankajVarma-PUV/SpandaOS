# SpandaOS — The Living Pulse of Agentic Intelligence
# A self-pulsing intelligence that lives at the core of the system — perpetually vibrating, continuously learning from every interaction, self-correcting its own errors, and driving all reasoning from a single living center — not because it was told to, but because that is its fundamental nature.
